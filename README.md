# Thermal TrackKing

**HackRiddle 2017 Hackathon Entry**

&nbsp;

We constructed an IoT and analytics device that helps keep fire fighters safe while on duty.

## Motivation

Thermal TrackKing is a concept that was created after speaking with a few Firemen.

Firefighters are provided with protective clothing that is designed to protect its wearers from the thermal environments experienced during firefighting. However, protective clothing may respond differently to the transfer of heat, and firefighters may receive serious burn injuries due to these transfers of heat, even if they maintain a significant distance from the physical fire.

The reason being, their protective clothing has certain physical limits in its ability to protect the wearer. All thermal protective clothing have these limits, and these limits are measurable, but a firefighter may not recognize these critical limits until he is already experiencing a burn injury.

Thermal TrackKing was created upon reflecting on the conversations we had with the Firemen. After these conversations, it was evident that there was two glaring, concurrent themes in all the discussions: 1) Individual Selflessness, and 2) Pride.

First, Individual Selflessness. One of the most important things you can do is to let people know they are not alone. When speaking with the Firemen, it was obvious to us that these were words they lived by.

Every story they told us had the same theme: “We were told there was someone stuck in the building, so we went in.” We asked, if they ever worried when doing so. We were always met with the same response. A resounding “No, we’re just focused on getting the person to safety.” This concept resonated with our team. These men were running into absolute danger and the only thing running through their mind was the safety of a complete stranger.

Second, Pride. Many of the firefighters spoke of what they called “the unwritten rule of shame.” Firefighters work as a unit. So, when they enter into a building, they have to do it as a unit. The same goes with exiting the building. When one firefighter leaves, the whole team has to exit with him.

Firefighters tend to suffer burns when their protective clothing’s limits reach their peak. The Firefighters explained that many times they would know they were getting burned, but simply pushed through the pain as they did not want to be the one responsible for making their entire unit turn back, ultimately placing themselves and the unit in a difficult position when the burn injuries start to become more severe.

**Note:** This application was meant to be used with the relevant hardware we created during our hackathon. Because you will not have access to our hardware, you will only be able to view an example of our applications dashboard. While viewing this live project, please keep in mind that our applications dashboard contains static "dummy" data, due to the lack of hardware needed for a proper demonstration.
